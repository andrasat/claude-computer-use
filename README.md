# claude-computer-use

A Testing Repository to try Claude Computer Use, using example resources from [Anthropic Quickstarts](https://github.com/anthropics/anthropic-quickstarts), adjusted for my needs. In this repository, I just want to test capabilities of Claude Computer Use and how can I utilize this with different tooling.

## Getting Started

### ANTHROPIC_API_KEY

You will need to acquire your own `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY` and put it inside `.env` file in this root project. You can see the example in `.env.example`.

### Running Locally

Since this is just for local development, you can adjust your needs by configuring stuff here:

- dev-requirements.txt: "libraries used"
- setup.sh: "python env setup"
- run.sh: "building docker & runner script"

to run the app, you can just run

```bash
$ ./run.sh
```
